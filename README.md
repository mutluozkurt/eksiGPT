EksiGPT is a browser extension forked from the [ChatGPTBox](https://github.com/josStorer/chatGPTBox) project, created for entertainment purposes. It aims to make writing and reading experiences on [Ek≈üi S√∂zl√ºk](https://eksisozluk.com/) much easier and more enjoyable.

It includes all the features of [ChatGPTBox](https://github.com/josStorer/chatGPTBox). In addition, it has some buttons customized for [Ek≈üi S√∂zl√ºk](https://eksisozluk.com/).

üìù Edit Spelling: Detects and corrects spelling errors in your entries. Your writings become error-free and readable.

üí° Suggest Ideas: Suggests new entry ideas based on your entry or topic title.

üîç Summarize: Summarizes long entries in a few sentences, speeding up the reading experience. You can access summarized information without getting lost in long texts.

üìå Title Suggestion: When creating a new title, Ek≈üi S√∂zl√ºk's "Guidelines for Creating Titles" are followed to suggest the most suitable, attention-grabbing, and meaningful titles based on your content. This ensures your title is more consistent and understandable.


üí¨ Ask EksiGPT: When you click on a title, a special chat area opens on the right side. With this feature:</br>
You can instantly see a summary of the entries in that title.
You can chat with AI about the topic and get analysis.

## News

- This extension does **not** collect your data. You can verify it by conducting a global search for `fetch(` and `XMLHttpRequest(` in the code to find all network request calls. The amount of code is not much, so it's easy to do that.

- This tool will not transmit any data to ChatGPT unless you explicitly ask it to. By default, the extension must be activated manually. It will only send a request to ChatGPT if you specifically click "Ask ChatGPT" or trigger the selection floating tools ‚Äî and this is applicable only when you're using GPT API modes. (issue #407)

- You can use projects like https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm / https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api to convert LLM APIs into OpenAI format and use them in conjunction with ChatGPTBox's `Custom Model` mode

- You can also use [Ollama](https://github.com/josStorer/chatGPTBox/issues/616#issuecomment-1975186467) / https://openrouter.ai/docs#models with ChatGPTBox's `Custom Model` mode
